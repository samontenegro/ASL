# Prodeus Autosplitter
## Description
ASL file for [Prodeus](https://www.prodeusgame.com/). Does not time during loads (load remover), and splits automatically upon reaching the results screen of each level. May be configured to optionally split when

- transitioning from the Intro level to Sacrum
- reaching the results screen of the Shop

Do note this ASL script **continues to time in the overworld, during pause, and while the weapon wheel HUD is open**, but may be easily modified to not do so.

## Requirements
[Just-ero](https://github.com/just-ero/)'s amazing ASL Helper, which is available [here](https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/blob/main/lib/asl-help).
