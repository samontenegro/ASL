# Signalis Autosplitter
## Description
ASL file for [Signalis](http://rose-engine.org/signalis//). May be configured not time during loads, cutscenes or door traversals (load remover), and splits automatically upon changing levels. Split locations may be individually turned on or off, but both the start and end splits are fixed. Do note this ASL script **continues to time in the main menu, while the inventory is open, and while dialog is running**.

## Requirements
